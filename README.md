General Idea
An online game that prompts the user to deliver treatments to a patient. The patient’s Life Force number will either improve or deteriorate. If their score improves up to 100, then they’re cured and the player’s score improves. However, if their score dwindles down to zero, then they have died and the player’s score goes down.

Target Audience
People who like to unwind by playing games on their phones, tablets, or computers.

Primary Problem
When people are commuting or have other pockets of “down-time” they want to do something that is interesting but not too engaging, since they expect to be interrupted. Games are perfect for these times. Many people also enjoy playing games to unwind and relax at the end of the day.

Primary Goal
To provide entertainment. This is a game that is fun to play. It can be learned quickly, it delivers instant gratification, as the player’s score is continuously impacted. The life-or-death context of the game adds an element of excitement as well.
