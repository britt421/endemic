## Several Endemic Diseases, One Top Secret Lab and Three Top Specialists!
  Several contagious diseases have broken out all over the world. Fight the diseases as one of the three specialists in the game by administering highly controversial treatments to the patient? These treatments are highly potent but extremely volatile and unpredictable.
  
  This game is playable on any modern web browser and is equally enjoyable on mobile, tablet or desktop devices.
  
  Good luck to you and your patient! (especially your patient!!!)
