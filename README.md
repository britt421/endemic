#### 3. Play the Game:
  * The patient has a highly contagious disease, associated symptoms, and is at half their life force (50 points).
  * Your character has at his disposal three treaments that are to be tested on this disease. Click on the treatment to administer it.
  * The game logs the effect/reaction of the treatment and the resulting life force value for the patient.
  * Continue to administer the treatments as you see fit until the patient returns to full life force (100) or dies (0).
  * At this point a pop-up gives you the choice to select a new avatar and play a new game.
